There 3 shaders:
Sway_Move_ALL.
Move whole sprite realative to the bottom. Bottom still moves, so it would be a right choice for grass.

Sway_Bottom_STILL.
Same as previous one only with a locked bottom. Great for both grass and leafs.

SwayRAND_Bottom_STILL.
Variation of the previos one with locked bottom. This time there is random variation in movement that can be adjusted throuh "random seed". Help add variation to movement.


Chose whichever you wish or all, they all have their uses.
